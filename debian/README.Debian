The channel archiver tools (arget, argrep, arinfo) follow
the usual convention for configuration with files searched in order

/etc/carchive.conf
~/.carchiverc
$PWD/carchive.conf

Each file overwrites settings from the previous.

The file /etc/carchive.conf.example has some explaination
of the options which can be used.
